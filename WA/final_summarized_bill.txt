=== Simplified Legislative Bill ===

**House Bill 1633 – Simplified Version**

**Purpose:** This bill modifies the requirements for prime contractors when they submit bids for public works projects in Washington state.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Bidding Requirements:**
   - For state public works projects costing $1,000,000 or more, bidders must specify their subcontractors for specific types of work.
   - At the time of bid submission, bidders must provide the names and licenses of subcontractors for HVAC, plumbing, and electrical work or state that they will perform the work themselves if licensed.
   - Within 48 hours after the bid submission, bidders need to list subcontractors for structural steel and rebar installation.

2. **Subcontractor Listing:**
   - Only one subcontractor can be named per work category unless variations are due to bid alternates.
   - Listing more than one subcontractor for the same work without specifying alternates makes a bid invalid.

3. **Subcontractor Substitution:**
   - Substituting a listed subcontractor to engage in what is known as "bid shopping" or "bid peddling" is prohibited.
   - If substitution occurs for certain reasons (e.g., subcontractor refusal to sign a contract, bankruptcy, inability to meet project requirements), it’s permitted.
   - The original subcontractor can claim damages if substituted improperly, but they must prove that improper practices occurred.

4. **Exceptions:**
   - The subcontractor listing requirements do not apply to certain types of procurement methods such as design-build, general contractor/construction manager, or job order contract requests for proposals.

5. **Additional Context:**
   - This bill concerns specific subcontractor work categories: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, structural steel, and rebar.
   - It aims to prevent unfair bidding practices and promote transparency and fairness in public work contracts.

**Effective Date:** The proposed changes would apply to contracts entered into after the passage of this bill. Specific implementation dates are not given but the bill moved forward in the legislative session in 2025.
